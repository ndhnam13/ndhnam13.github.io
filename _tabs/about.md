**Hello, my name is Nam, and I am currently studying Cybersecurity.**

My interests include system security, malware analysis, network and endpoint forensics, and capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions. In CTFs, I mainly focus on the **forensics** and **miscellaneous** categories. This blog serves as a space to document my learning journey and share writeups of the more challenging CTF problems I've encountered.
